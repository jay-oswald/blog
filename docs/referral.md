Heres the referal links I have, they are all things I activatly use and like, and give both of us bonuses if you use them. All the rates I said are at time of writing and do change.

## OVO

Ovo is a providor, and for most states have a plan where you can get 3 hours free usage 11am till 2pm, with very low supply charge. They also have an EV plan giving very low import rates (8c for me) from midnight till 6am, as well as 8c exports all the time.

OVO gives us both $10/month discount for first 12 months

## Exetel

Exetel are one of the cheapest NBN providers, they also almost never have a queue to wait if you do need support.

Exetel gives me $9.90/month for first 6 months, they do not say if you get anything.

## UP Bank
